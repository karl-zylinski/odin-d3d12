TODO:

* fix UV strangeness. Normals seem to get in OK, but UVs seem broken.
    * Is our processing of obj index hopping wrong?
    * Or is our sampler broken?
    * Or is the vertexinput data wrong? Unsure, since the positions are all correct!
* d3d12 renderer should not be dependent on shader_system. I think?
* Is BeginPass actually BeginDrawCall and DrawCall -> SubmitDrawCall. Maybe?
* Move BufferWithNamedOffsets to separate file or sumth
* Maybe we can move the queue etc to State struct and then have an explicit Swapchain (or whatever it should be called) creation command that returns a handle to it. Then SetRenderTarget etc can take either a resource or a swapchain. Maybe?! We might get rid of Pipeline state struct then, if previous point are also done.
* Replace delay_destruction with fences that are checked each frame
    * Just a destroy_counter that gets signaled on fence, check how completed it is and release all pending-to-be-destroyed resources that have a lower counter value
* Render targets, render to off-screen target
    * Step 1: Render to off-screen target and then fullscreen blit that target to backbuffer (just a test)
    * Step 2: Render to GBuffer and make it possible to blit out specific parts of GBuffer
    * Step 3: Assemble picture from GBuffer
* Lienar color spaces?

DONE:

* Fix build system include path so I dont have to write ".." in front of things. I.e. make my project like vendor: or core:
* CBV heap is currently advanced by 33 slots each frame. Instead, get this information from the Shader and advance it properly depending on the set shader.
* Textures
    X CreateTexture exists now, but when does the upload heap die? It can't be released before copying is done.
    X Make them uploadable and settable from using commands
    * Can we merge their mgmt with constant buffers, some resource concept?
        * No
X We are passing pipeline objects everywhere. Many are just used to get to the cmdlist. Can we do something like where we have a 'current pass' that is being prepared and have the cmdlist in there?
X ResourceTransition command seems broken. There is no resource to set?
* Somehow pre-package the constant buffer data in staging memory and upload to GPU each frame.
    X Should be able to get rid of constant_buffer_memory_info
    X p.constant_buffer_desc check the size of this one. Some aligment thing? Shaders need to have enough self-knowledge so we can calculate things like constant_buffer_desc and dsv_desc of Pipeline struct on the fly.
* Vertex buffers bindless
* Render something with a normal map and albedo
