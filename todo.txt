TODO:

* Textures
    * CreateTexture exists now, but when does the upload heap die? It can't be released before copying is done.
    * Make them uploadable and settable from using commands
    * Can we merge their mgmt with constant buffers, some resource concept?
* Vertex & index buffers bindless
* Render targets, render to off-screen target
    * Step 1: Render to off-screen target and then fullscreen blit that target to backbuffer (just a test)
    * Step 2: Render to GBuffer and make it possible to blit out specific parts of GBuffer
    * Step 3: Assemble picture from GBuffer
* Lienar color spaces?
